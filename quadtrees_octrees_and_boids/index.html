    <h1>Quadtrees, Octrees and Boids</h1>
    <p>
        As a personal project I wanted to create Boids algorithm out of a fascination for
        autonomous AI interactions and emergent properties. This, and the simple nature of
        the algorithm made it a good candidate for a project to deepen my understanding of
        game AI and natural simulations.

    <h2>
        Spacial Partitioning
    </h2>
    <p>
        I wanted to build my octrees in 3D and performance was not a consideration as this
        will only be an educational prototype - so I chose Unreal Engine due to my familiarity.
        <br><br>
        I went through and begun building the boids, I had them purely moving forward when I
        started connecting then together, I very quickly discovered a project-halting bottleneck,
        any more than around 40 boid actors and the project would begin to crawl. This was because
        every boid was checking the location and direction of each other boid.
        Each new boid will add an exponential amount of compute.

        I learned the solution is Octrees, a spacial partitioning algorithm that pre orginises
        all the nodes and then queried only sends back a few compared to hundreds. I begin by
