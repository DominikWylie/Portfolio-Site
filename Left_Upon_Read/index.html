            <h1>Left Upon Read</h1>
            <p>Left Upon read is a – dark fantasy, fast-paced, multitasking, combat game, where you need to
                navigate dungeons, kill enemies with your sword and magic while balancing responding to text
                messages at the same time.

                We created this over 3 months or 36 days, I worked in a team of 9 people to create Left Upon
                Read for our 3rd year professional project, with 3 programmers, 3 designers, 2 artists and a
                project lead. We then got in to Abertay’s DARE Academy and continued development in hothousing,
                one month full time development in mostly the same team of 7 people where we focused on polish
                and making it a great EGX experience.

                We applied and were accepted to show off out game at the Glasgow Independent Games Festival
                along side other indie projects and successful indie games, and has been selected by Abertay
                university for their submission for the Best student game category at the TIGA education awards.

            <h2>My Contribution</h2>
            <p>All the programmers did what needed to get done so we all worked on all parts of the program and learned
                a lot about the full development cycle. I focused primarily on the phone mechanic, messaging mechanics,
                bug fixing and player experience. Because the phone mechanic was novel it was created from scratch with
                the help of Unreal’s UMG UI and other unreal components. All the programmers helped manage the git repo
                with unreal.
