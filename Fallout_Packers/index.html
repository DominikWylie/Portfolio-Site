        Fallout Packers is a game where you are in an apocalypse and need to survive by crafting, farming and 
        venturing out to the wilderness. To do this you need to find tools and supplies, pack your bag properly to 
        bring supplies with you like food and tools like an axe or wrench which will change your chances of getting 
        better loot and specific loot to the tool. To make it to the next day with the aim to find your family.

        We made the game in unity 2D for a week long game jam. I focused on the items, physics based storage and 
        crafting system. The storage included a rucksack and chest where the items in the chest stay in the hut and 
        the items in the rucksack get brought with you in expeditions. The crafting system included checking all the 
        craftable items and checking the recipes against the available items and if the player chooses an item to 
        craft, the required items disappear and the crafted item falls in to view.
        <br><br>
        I also created a designer friendly interface and data structure for the designers to add as many items and 
        as many items to the recipes as they wanted. This meant the designers could easily iterate on gameplay balancing 
        while I continue to develop. Adding a new item was easy as all it required was setting up collision and adding it 
        to the crafting list with a few clicks.
