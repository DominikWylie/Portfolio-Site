        I created an unreal project based off a UE5 portals demonstration for my 2nd 
        year game mechanics class. My main aim was to get the portals working but instead of the YouTuber I 
        was following did it all in blueprints I did almost all of it in c++. The 
        portals are visually and physically functioning.

    <p>
        They work using cameras taking the player’s camera position and translating it to the 
        exit portal, and using that render in a texture and placing it on the first portal. 
        There were a few things to work out with the fov being different between the camera 
        and the portal frame, and fixing “banana juice” the effect of seeing things before 
        the portal because of the positioning of the camera. I achieved going through the 
        portals, and going through them at different angles and resetting the camera angle smoothly.
